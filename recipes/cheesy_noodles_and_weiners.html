    <p>God only knows what is actually in hot dogs and that fake powdered cheese can't be healthy</p>
    <div id="subtitle">Ingredients:</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Package of hot dogs</li>
        <li>Box of mac and cheese (velveeta is the best but my wife buys Kraft :(</li>
        <li>milk</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>Condiments</li>
    </ul>
    <div id="subtitle">Cooking Instructions:</div>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil some water</li>
        <li>Put the noodles in boiling water for about 7 minutes (unless you like 'em limp)</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill</li>
        <li>Toss weiners on the grill until the are charred (no one likes a half cooked weiner)</li>
        <li>Strain noodles</li>
        <li>Now things get a little sketchy: <br>
            If you used Velveeta, squeeze that liquid gold over the noodles. Chug the milk and throw butter at your cat to express your dominance. <br>
            If you went with Kraft, stir the milk, butter, and whatever that fake powder cheese shit is into the noodles.</li>
        <li>Trust me your gonna want to season this with salt, pepper, ketchup, mustard, cyanide, whatever you have</li>

    </ol>
